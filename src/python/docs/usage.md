# Usage

## Dashboard

The Dashboard page shows all the files and directories on the remote server and the local machine.
Here you can manually queue files to be transferred, extract archives and delete files.

## AutoQueue

AutoQueue queues all newly discovered files on the remote server.
You can also restrict AutoQueue to pattern-based matches (see this option in the Settings page).
When pattern restriction is enabled, the AutoQueue page is where you can add or remove patterns.
Any files or directories on the remote server that match a pattern will be automatically queued for transfer.
